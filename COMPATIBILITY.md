# ThumbyP8 Cart Compatibility

Last updated: 2026-04-12

## Status Key
- **Playable** — loads, controls work, plays to completion or reasonable extent
- **Partial** — loads but has issues (visual glitches, some features broken)
- **Broken** — crashes, hangs, or unplayable
- **Untested** — needs retesting after recent fixes

## Test Results

## Known Limitations
- Carts using mouse input (fsgupicozombiegarden) won't work — no mouse on Thumby Color
- Very large carts may OOM during _init (lootslime) — 300KB Lua heap cap
- P8SCII special characters in strings display as blocks, not glyphs
- Some carts hang in _init (beam, mossmoss, lorez) — needs investigation
- Button glyph display in strings shows numbers instead of icons

## Recent Fixes (2026-04-12)
- Button/arrow glyphs now correctly map to button indices 0-5 (was using P8SCII byte values)
- All bitwise ops (& | ^ ~ << >> >>> <<> >><) now use 16.16 fixed-point via function calls
- Fixed-point results return as integer when fractional part is zero (Lua 5.4 int/float key distinction)
- PXA decompressor: removed 32-iteration limit on back-ref length (was truncating 4 carts)
- Conversion scan now finds all carts (was limited to first 16)
- In-game pause menu added (long-press MENU)
